React Rendering: Understanding Mounting & Commit Phases
React rendering happens in two main phases:

Render Phase (a.k.a. Reconciliation)
Commit Phase
Let’s break them down!

1️⃣ Render Phase (aka "Mounting" for First Render)
This phase is purely virtual—it doesn’t interact with the actual DOM yet.

What Happens Here?
✅ React creates a Virtual DOM tree by calling the component functions.
✅ It compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one (Diffing Algorithm).
✅ It prepares the minimal changes needed for the actual DOM update.
✅ This phase can be paused, interrupted, or discarded (thanks to React Fiber).

⏳ During Initial Render (Mounting):

React constructs the component tree from scratch.
Lifecycle methods like constructor, getDerivedStateFromProps, and render are called.
⏳ During Updates (Re-Render):

React recalculates what changed.
Lifecycle methods like shouldComponentUpdate and render are invoked.
🚨 Key Point: The Render Phase does not touch the actual DOM!

2️⃣ Commit Phase (aka "DOM Update Phase")
Once React decides on the changes, it moves to the Commit Phase, where it updates the real DOM.

What Happens Here?
✅ React applies changes to the actual DOM & browser screen.
✅ Runs DOM-related side effects (e.g., refs, animations, subscriptions).
✅ Calls lifecycle methods like:

componentDidMount (After First Render)
componentDidUpdate (After Re-Render)
useEffect callbacks (In Functional Components)
🚨 Commit Phase is synchronous! Unlike the Render Phase, which can be interrupted, the Commit Phase runs to completion once it starts.

Key Takeaways
🔹 Render Phase (Mounting for first render): Creates Virtual DOM, calculates changes, and does NOT affect the actual DOM.
🔹 Commit Phase: Applies those changes to the real DOM & runs side effects.
🔹 React Fiber allows the Render Phase to be paused, but the Commit Phase is always synchronous.

## Understanding React Re-Rendering: Behind the Scenes 🔄

### 📌 Why Does a React Component Re-Render?
React components re-render when their state or props change. This ensures the UI remains updated with the latest data. Without re-rendering, React apps would behave like static web pages.

### 📌 The Truth About Re-Rendering
A common misconception is:

> “A component re-renders when its state changes or when it receives new props.”

While this is somewhat true, it's not entirely accurate! The real mechanism is more nuanced.

### 🔍 What Actually Happens?

#### State Change Triggers a Re-Render
- When a component's state changes, React re-renders that component.
- **Example:** Clicking an Increment button updates the state, triggering a re-render.

#### Parent Component Re-Renders → All Children Re-Render
- If a component re-renders, all its child components will also re-render, even if they don’t rely on the changed state.
- **Example:** A child component that doesn't use state (or receive props) will still re-render if its parent does.

#### Why Does React Re-Render All Children?
- React assumes components might have side effects (like fetching API data, using the current time, etc.).
- Instead of checking whether a component is "pure" or "impure," React takes the safer approach and re-renders all children.

### 💡 Performance Concerns & Optimization
While this might seem inefficient, React is highly optimized using:

- **Reconciliation Algorithm:** Identifies minimal DOM updates using the Virtual DOM.
- **Surgical Updates:** Only the necessary parts of the UI are updated, not the entire DOM.

### 🛑 Preventing Unnecessary Re-Renders
If a component is truly pure (its output depends only on its props), we can optimize it using:

- **React.memo:** Prevents re-renders unless props actually change.

### ⚡ Key Takeaways:
- ✅ A component re-renders when its state changes.
- ✅ This causes all of its child components to re-render as well.
- ✅ React efficiently updates the DOM using Virtual DOM & Reconciliation.
- ✅ Use React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders for pure components.
